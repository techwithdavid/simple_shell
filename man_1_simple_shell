.SH NAME

.B simple_shell (hsh)
- command interpreter (shell)



.SH SYNOPSIS

.B	./hsh



.SH COPYRIGHT

.SH DESCRIPTION

simple_shell replicates a command line interpreter (a shell), which is a user \
interface program for access to an operating system's services.  This shell \
is designed to interact with a linux distribution or unix like system that \
uses linux system calls and other commands found in the linux PATH, for \
example, the
.B $PATH:
.P
.RS
.B /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:
.P
.RE
simple_shell has a set of custom built-in commands, and also integrates with other \
commands located in the system's PATH.  The output is designed to exactly or \
as close as possible replicate the shell 'sh' or 'dash'
.B $ man dash
.  simple_shell \
takes commands from files, shell scripts or user input in either an \
interactive or non-interactive mode (explained in INVOCATION section).




.SH INVOCATION

to initialize simple_shell, you must compile all the included files using the GNU \
compiler collection: gcc.  Then run the output file, with a command such as \
this: $ ./a.out.  simple_shell has been written to pass all of these warning checks \
and was designed to be compiled with the following command:
.P
.RS
.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
.P
.RE
if simple_shell is executed, it will initialize in what is considered 'interactive \
mode.'  In this scenario, the user is prompted for a command and then the \
command is executed after the newline or 'enter' is input.  simple_shell can also \
function in non-interactive mode by using shell scripts, such as a '|' before
the simple_shell executable file ('hsh').  This is an example:
.P
.RS
.B $ echo 'ls' | ./hsh
.P
.RE
Commands may also be input into simple_shell through a file containing commands:
.P
.RS
.B $ cat aFile | ./hsh
.P
.RE



.SH OPTIONS

simple_shell does not take any options but does utilize the variable extern char \
**environ.  This is currently part of the future goals of simple_shell
